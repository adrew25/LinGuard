# LinGuard 🛡️

Welcome to **LinGuard**, your trusty (and a bit over-enthusiastic) sidekick in the never-ending battle against Linux malware! LinGuard is here to help sniff out those sneaky processes, shady files, and suspicious network shenanigans. Is it perfect? Nope! But it’s a work in progress, and like every good hero, it’s getting better every day.

> **Warning**: LinGuard is still sharpening its sword (read: in development). Don’t expect it to save the world just yet, but it’s got potential!

## **What LinGuard Can Do (Someday Soon™)**
- 🕵️ **Process Scanning**: Sort of works for now, but we’ll make it smarter and snappier. Think of it as LinGuard’s training montage.
- 🗂️ **File Integrity Checks**: Coming soon! LinGuard will make sure no files go rogue on your system.
- 🌐 **Network Monitoring**: Also coming soon. LinGuard will be your digital bouncer, catching network activity that doesn’t belong.
- 💻 **Cool UI with NiceGUI (Under search of what gui i will use)**: Because who wants to type all day? Look out for a snazzy interface to make scanning fun!

## **LinGuard's Ambitious Dreams**
- **Dynamic Threat Lists**: LinGuard dreams of fetching the latest bad-guy lists from the internet.
- **Custom Rules**: Your system, your rules! Add your own suspicious patterns for files, processes, or network activity.
- **World Domination (Linux Edition)**: Okay, maybe just cross-platform support.
